      <question>Do I need to use Maven if I use Eclipse?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          If you use Eclipse to program Java you will find buttons to run your program and test it.
          Our tests were written using JUnit, which Eclipse also understands. So in principle you
          would not need Maven to run anything if you use Eclipse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then why do I suggest you should run Maven instead? There is a number of reasons. The
          first one is that Maven is probably the de facto standard to compile, test, and run Java.
          You will need to learn Maven sooner or later. Maven does much more than simply running
          Java. One of the main advantages of using Maven is that it manages dependencies for you,
          which out-of-the-box Eclipse does not.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, the best of both worlds can be reached if you import your project in Eclipse as
          a Maven project. So Eclipse will use Maven behind the scenes to manage dependencies and
          build everything for you.

    <faq id="vagrant_window_doesnt_want">
      <question>When I start the VM using "vagrant up" a window comes out. What is it and how to get rid of it?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          This is the VirtualBox window. VirtualBox show such a window to let users interact
          directly with the VM. But in this course we encourage students to use SSH instead. So
          this window is only useful for beginners who are not familiar with SSH yet.
        </p>
         <p>
          To get rid of this window, edit the <code>Vagrantfile</code> and change the value of
          <code>v.gui</code> to <code>false</code>. Changes will be effective the next time you
          turn on the VM.

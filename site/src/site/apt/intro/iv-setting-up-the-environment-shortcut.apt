Step 1 and 2 - Linux shortcut

[../images/setup-process-shortcut.svg]

  This method is either for the extremely impatient or for project contributors. This is how we
  create our own VM image. Here we assume that you have an Ubuntu Linux. So this process will not
  work on other platforms.
  
  If you only have time to type a single in the command line, here it is. But before you run it,
  make sure you trust the contents of
  {{{http://aamm.github.io/02j/vagrant/envSetup.sh}envSetup.sh}}. The line bellow is asking your
  computer to download such script and execute it. If the script contains anything that can harm
  your computer, do not run it.
  
* Run this on the terminal

-----------------------------------------------------------------
wget -q -O - http://aamm.github.io/02j/vagrant/envSetup.sh | bash
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  
* Next, Vagrant tutorial or Step 3

  Now you can proceed to the {{{./v-vagrant-mini-tutorial.html}Mini Vagrant Tutorial}}
  or {{{../lessons/lessons.html}Step 3, the lessons}}.

Warning

  Always check the scripts you run in your computer. They might contain code that was maliciously
  written to damage your data or to steal sensitive information.
